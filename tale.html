    <h1>A Modest Proposal</h1>
    <p class="lead">For preventing the children of poor people in Ireland,
      from being a burden on their parents or country,
      and for making them beneficial to the publick.</p>
    <h2>by Dr. Jonathan Swift</h2>
    <p><time datetime="1729">1729</time></p>
    <p>It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel in the country, when they see the
      streets, the roads, and cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six
      children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work
      for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless
      infants who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight
      for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.</p>
